#### OOP-Text-Based-RPG
I just create this repository because I just want to make practice of my OOP (Object-Oriented-Programming) skills. With that project, I'm going to make a native super simple RPG Text Based game using C# on Windows Form Application.

#### What are the classes/objects in our game? 
For our game, we want to do these things:

- The player goes to locations.
- The player may need to have certain items to enter a location.
- The location might have a quest available.
- To complete a quest, the player must collect certain items and turn them in.
- The player can collect items by going to a location and fighting monsters there.
- The player fights monsters with weapons.
- The player can use a healing potion while fighting.
- The player receives loot items after defeating a monster.
- After turning in the quest, the player receives reward items.

So, the nouns (classes/objects) in this game will be Player, Location, Item, Quest, Monster,
Weapon and Healing Potion. We'll need a few others, but we can start with these.

#### What will the game look like?
