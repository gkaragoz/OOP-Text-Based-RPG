Features for adding a vendor

Here are the changes we need to make:
1. Add a price to items
2. Create a new Vendor class. This class will have properties for the vendor's name and
their inventory.
3. Change the Location class, to hold an (optional) Vendor at that location
4. Change the UI to let the player buy and sell items with the vendor
