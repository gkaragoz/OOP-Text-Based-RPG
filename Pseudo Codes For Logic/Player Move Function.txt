Here is an outline of the logic for a player move function as pseudo-code.

1 If the location has an item required to enter it
	2 If the player does not have the item
		3 Display message
		3 Don't let the player move here (stop processing the move)
1 Update the player's current location
	2 Display location name and description
	2 Show/hide the available movement buttons
1 Completely heal the player (we assume they rested/healed while moving)
	2 Update hit points display in UI
1 Does the location have a quest?
	2 If so, does the player already have the quest?
		3 If so, is the quest already completed?
			4 If not, does the player have the items to complete the quest?
				5 If so, complete the quest
					6 Display messages
					6 Remove quest completion items from inventory
					6 Give quest rewards
					6 Mark player's quest as completed
		3 If not, give the player the quest
			4 Display message
			4 Add quest to player quest list
1 Is there a monster at the location?
	2 If so,
		3 Display message
		3 Spawn new monster to fight
		3 Display combat comboboxes and buttons
			4 Repopulate comboboxes, in case inventory changed
	2 If not
		3 Hide combat comboboxes and buttons
